# playing-with-scripts

This script is for when you've got a folder full of movies and series, but you don't want to decide which to watch. It was mainly written to choose a random "Friends" episode.
Running the script will randomly choose a media file from your folder (of folders). Just specify the path in the beginning in "x".
